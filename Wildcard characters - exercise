Extract all individuals from the ‘employees’ table whose first name contains “Jack”.

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
WHERE
    first_name LIKE ('%Jack%');


Once you have done that, extract another list containing the names of employees that do not contain “Jack”.

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    EMPLOYEES
WHERE
    first_name NOT LIKE ('%Jack%');
